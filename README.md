  1- Selenium C#.
  2- Selenium Java.
  3- Robot Framework.

 The benefit of using this utiltity is the dramatic save of time that would be otherwise wasted inspecting the elements and writing the code for this element.
 it generates clean, well-structed code that can be easily plugged into your desirable IDE(visual studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ, PyCharm...etc)
